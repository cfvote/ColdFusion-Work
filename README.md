# ColdFusion-Work
Some CF utils and random testing files I've used in the process of upgrading/maintaining the legacy ColdFusion code. Also includes any other random CF program I've written at work.

## File Descriptions

* Intro-To-CF --- Introductory CF, learning syntax, etc.
* index.cfm --- landing page for my testing folder
* application.cfc --- component called by local CF server for my testing folder
* Barrett-Utils.cfc --- useful functions that can be reused in other CF programs
* Testing
  * pentonAPI-test.http  --- Example using a cool VSCode extension to perform HTTP Requests
* Batch Scripts
  * CF-Server.bat  --- Stops local CF server instance and then starts it
  * Update-Source.bat -- Updates/Cleans CF and Java code using SVN. Moves Java jars to folder for local CF server
