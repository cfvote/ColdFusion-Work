# ColdFusion-Work
Some CF utils and random testing files I've used in the process of upgrading/maintaining the legacy ColdFusion code. Also includes any other random CF program I've written at work.

## File Descriptions

* index.cfm --- landing page for my testing folder and any other temporary tests I might run
* application.cfc --- component called by local CF server for my testing folder
* Barrett-Utils.cfc --- useful functions that can be reused in other CF programs
* Testing
  * pentonAPI-test.http  --- Example using VSCode extension to perform HTTP Requests
  * BinaryDecimalConverter.cfc --- A simple binary/decimal converter used in my introduction to mxunit testing
  * BinaryDecimalTest.cfc --- My introduction to mxunit testing
